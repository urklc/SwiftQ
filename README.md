# SwiftQ

This is a monorepo that contains:

• an example SwiftUI project which is created only for demonstration purposes and contains highly simplified approaches to satisfy teaching purposes.
• several Firebase Cloud Functions (triggered by the SwiftUI app) to guide mobile developers to create their own backend with basic functionality.
